## Project Description
This is a robot meant to play the card game spoons. This robot was created to play singleplayer or multiplayer, taking cards from a draw "pile", comparing them to its stored hand and choosing to keep/discard them. The robot has a temporary storage for cards being transferred to hand, and uses OpenCV for various forms of card detection and classification. The code is meant to be fully modular, using different pipeline configurations of neural networks and presets for smooth operation.
