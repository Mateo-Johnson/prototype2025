## Project Description
The robot combines human-like physical motion with AI-driven decision-making. Left in charge of managing a fast-paced matching-based card game, the system uses OpenCV for neural network-based card classification to identify, track, and evaluate cards as they are played, running a strategy analysis after every move. The system is fully modular, allowing vision models, strategies, and motion constraints to be updated independently. With motion constraints derived from human movement benchmarks and a state-driven decision framework, the robot reacts dynamically to human players and changing game conditions. This project highlights AMD hardware’s strength for real-time workloads that demand reliability and scalable performance.

## Wiring Diagram
No wiring diagram available for this, as no external hardware was used. 

Optional notes:
- Power requirements are 12V/5V for the two arms
- Both arms communicate with the host computer over UART
